# Troubleshooting the Creation of an EC2 Instance

## Activity Overview

In this activity, you will use the AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI) to launch Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instances. When creating the instance, you will utilize a user data script to configure the server with a LAMP stack—Linux, Apache web server, MariaDB (a fork of MySQL), and PHP. This setup is a typical approach for deploying websites with a database backend on a single machine.

Additionally, the user data script will deploy website files and execute database configuration scripts. The final outcome is an EC2 instance hosting the Café Web Application, demonstrating a practical application of a LAMP stack in a real-world scenario.
